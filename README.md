Bitcoin Scrypt v1.3.0

If you understand source code at a level where you can compile your own client, then you do not need a guide.

For all the users that are not sure about compiling from source please use the pre-compiled wallet clients on our websites.

This will help to make everything run a little bit smoother.

A quick start guide to get the wallet up and running will be in the readme file that comes with the client download.

Thank you.
